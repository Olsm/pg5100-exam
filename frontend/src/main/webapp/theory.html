<h1>Theory - PG5100 Exam Autumn 2016</h1>
<hr />
<p><strong>1) Explain the main differences between JPQL and SQL, and why one might rather want to use JPQL when developing JEE programs.</strong></p>
<p>Java Persistence Query Language is based on SQL and the syntax is similiar. It is used to simplify creating and reading entities in a relational database. SQL works directly against the database. JPQL works with java class instances. Using JPQL makes it simple to return entity objects, instead of having to manually convert result set to objects as you would with SQL.&nbsp;Entities are often related to each other and JPQL has features to navigate "one to one", "one to many", "many to many", and "many to one" relationships. However JPQL does have some limitations so you may have to use native SQL in some cases. When creating an enterprise application using java objects that should be saved in a database, and using relationships, there are many advantages in using JPQL.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2) In the context of JPA, explain the main differences between a &ldquo;pessimistic&rdquo; and an &ldquo;optimistic&rdquo; lock, and when one might choose to use one of them instead of the other.</strong></p>
<p>A pessimistic lock will lock for exclusive use by a thread, and it will not be available for other threads until it has been unlocked. An optimistic lock will allow other threads to use it, and when a thread has "saved" before the other the other will fail and have to try again. If you are optimistic that there wont be much concurrency, you might choose an optimistic lock, and if you are pessimistic and think that there will be a lot of concurrency, you might choose pessimistic. For example if an application has few users and/or a method is used rarely, you might choose optimistic. Or you might choose pessimistic if the opposite is true. There is also a higher risk of deadlocks using pessimistic so you need to be sure that the lock is released when something fails and in addition have timeouts as an extra safety. With optimistic locks one thread may be "stuck" for a long time if other threads beats it all the time to make a change. So it is important for performance that you make the best choice for your case.</p>

<p><strong>6) In a Maven project, explain the steps required to configure automated testing with Selenium, as done in class (eg., what needs to be configured, which Maven phases are involved, why the tests have to be written as integration instead of unit tests, how to automatically get and install a JEE container, etc).</strong></p>
